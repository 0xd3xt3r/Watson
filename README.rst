Watson

Watson is here to help you monitoring your time. You want to know how
much time you are spending on your projects? You want to generate a nice
report for your client? Watson is here for you.

Tell Watson when you start working on a task with the ``start`` command.
Then, when you are done with this task, stop the timer with the ``stop``
command. This will create what we call a **frame**. That's pretty much
everything you need to know to start using Watson.

Each frame consists of the name of a project and some tags. Your tags
can be shared across projects and can be used to generate detailed
reports.

Watson stores everything on your computer, but you can go wild and use
`artich.io <https://artich.io/?pk_campaign=GitHubWatson>`__ to store
your sessions remotely and share it with your colleagues.
